<h2>Elon Musk learns the hard way that being a Twitter troll is way more fun than being a mod</h2>

<p>Ihonestly did not think chaos would engulf Twitter so quickly, but I must admit: this rules. This owns so hard.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dril/status/568056615355740160">Awoooou (wolf howl)</a>, Twitter is good again. We’re no longer locked in here with Elon Musk —&nbsp;<em>Elon Musk has locked himself in here with us.</em></p>

<p>Musk took control of Twitter on October 27th. Since then:</p>

<p>Okay! So I have&nbsp;<em>some thoughts</em>&nbsp;about what the fuck is going on. First of all, Musk often changed his mind at Tesla, like when he decided he was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245296/tesla-stores-closing-online-only-car-sales">going to close all the brick-and-mortar</a>&nbsp;Tesla stores,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/11/18259580/tesla-price-hike-stores-reversal">then reversed himself</a>, or the time he decided that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk">Tesla was going to accept Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;until, uh,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk">it didn’t</a>. Teslas were going to be built by an “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16627528/tesla-perbix-acquisition-automated-factory-machine-builds-machines">alien dreadnought</a>,” which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17234296/tesla-model-3-robots-production-hell-elon-musk">didn’t work</a>. The quick reversals are not unusual for Musk. It’s just that Tesla is a business Musk built around his fandom, who are more understanding of this kind of behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twitter, however, is an acquisition and is not necessarily full of Musk fans. That means it’s a much less forgiving environment for Musk. Like, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.somethingawful.com/news/twitter-best-of/1/">early subset of Twitter users</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nzg4yw/fuck-you-and-die-an-oral-history-of-something-awful">Something Awful forum goons</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17907568/dril-book-official-mr-ten-years-anniversary-collection-review-tweets-twitter">the most prominent of whom is Dril</a>&nbsp;— and they&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;fucking with people. Plus, Musk’s Twitter Blue plan to devalue verification check marks motivated a bunch of people who didn’t like Musk to go out with a bang by impersonating him,&nbsp;<em>largely because they knew it would make him mad</em>. And it probably did! Certainly, that would explain why his very first policy change was to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/6/23443871/elon-musk-twitter-permaban-impersonation-parody">increase punishment for impersonation</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shenanigans are fun, but here’s the thing to keep in mind:&nbsp;Twitter is loaded with debt from the acquisition and needs to pay roughly $1 billion a year on it. In 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001418091/b021055f-fb7c-4dff-889c-8ee1964d78c5.html#">Twitter made $5 billion in&nbsp;<em>revenue</em></a>&nbsp;and did not turn a profit. “This isn’t complicated,” says Mike Roberts, a professor at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. “He owes a bunch of money, and he’s gotta raise money somewhere, somehow. What I wonder is about the ability of Twitter to pay this debt.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So Musk has to figure out how to make money while people scream at him and impersonate him. Fun job!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, one way to free up cash is to fire a lot of people. The problem with doing that, though, is that you lose a bunch of the engineers who could build cool shit to make Twitter more attractive. This is maybe not a major problem, as all tech companies are cutting people loose right now, so Musk can hire new talent on the cheap if he has to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It does get worse</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this does not solve a bigger problem, which is revenue. Last year, 89 percent of Twitter’s revenue —&nbsp;about $4.5 billion —&nbsp;came from advertising. The rest of the company’s income came from other streams, such as data licensing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s focus on the advertising problem for a minute.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/advertisers-begin-grill-elon-musk-over-twitter-free-for-all-2022-11-03/">A lot of brands have paused their spending,</a>&nbsp;and one ad exec who was on a call with Musk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/06/2022/a-top-ad-exec-says-elon-musk-is-being-petulant-and-thoughtless">called his behavior “petulant and thoughtless</a>.” This is an&nbsp;<em>immediate</em>&nbsp;problem because the fourth quarter is the most important one for any business that relies on advertising —&nbsp;including this here website. So a lot of major advertisers are pulling out of Twitter during a crucial period for the company to make money, something Musk himself has acknowledged. “Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue,”&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588538640401018880?">he tweeted</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It does get worse, and this part isn’t Musk’s fault. When the economy slows down, companies spend less money on advertising. So even if Musk weren’t doing wild stuff to alienate advertisers, such as tweeting conspiracy theories about Paul Pelosi, Twitter might have been in trouble anyway. But Musk has essentially identified himself and his company as a loose canon, which means that anyone looking to trim advertising spend might be inclined to cut Twitter first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, Twitter did set up Tips —&nbsp;a way to send cash to people you like — but it doesn’t take a&nbsp;<a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tips">cut of that money</a>. It does take a cut of the revenue from Super Follows, a way to make your tweets a subscription service, but&nbsp;<a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-follows#howmuchsf">Twitter’s share is dwarfed by the fees taken by Apple for in-app purchases</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the internet, and there’s forum drama</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So in terms of revenue, the action, at least right now, is mostly around Twitter Blue, a premium-tier version of Twitter that lets users, among other things, edit their tweets. Musk raised the price of that product to $8,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/7/23446262/elon-musk-twitter-paywall-possible">which may not be enough to cover its costs</a>. Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope math, shall we? A year of Twitter blue is $96, which I am going to round to $100 for the purposes of simpler math. If 10 million people sign up for a year, that’s $1 billion in revenue right there. Easy, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, no, because this is the internet, and there’s forum drama.&nbsp; Blue users get a blue check mark, which looks exactly like the check mark verified users get —&nbsp;but Twitter Blue customers don’t have to verify their identity, which is how an account with a blue check mark and the display name “Nintendo of America”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve">managed to put up a tweet of Mario flipping the bird</a>. To an unwary user, that might look sufficiently like the&nbsp;<em>actual</em>&nbsp;Nintendo account to do brand damage.</p>
